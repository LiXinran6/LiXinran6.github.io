## 👋 Welcome!

I am **LI Xinran (李欣然)**, a dual-degree **M.S. student** at **Waseda University** (Japan) and **Dalian University of Technology** (China), specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
My research focuses on **Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC)** and **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**, leveraging large language model techniques and designing **Curriculum Learning frameworks** for downstream NLP tasks.


> *“Advancing cutting-edge research on downstream tasks in natural language processing through LLMs.”*

## 🧩 Publications

**1. Do LLMs Feel? Teaching Emotion Recognition with Prompts, Retrieval, and Curriculum Learning**  
*AAAI 2026 (CORE A\*, **CCF A**)* — **First Author**  
> We propose **PRC-Emo**, a new ERC training framework that integrates **Prompt engineering**, **demo Retrieval**, and **Curriculum learning** to investigate whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversations. PRC-Emo introduces emotion-sensitive prompt templates capturing both explicit and implicit emotional cues, constructs the first **ERC-specific demonstration retrieval repository**, and incorporates curriculum strategies into **LoRA fine-tuning** via weighted emotional shifts. Experiments on **IEMOCAP** and **MELD** achieve **new SOTA results**, demonstrating the strong generalizability of our approach.  
[Paper (arXiv:2511.07061)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07061) | [Code (GitHub)](https://github.com/LiXinran6/PRC-Emo)

**2. Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Networks and Improved Curriculum Learning for Emotion Recognition in Conversation**  
*ECAI 2025 (CORE A, **CCF B**)* — **First Author**  
> Developed a novel **LSDGNN + ICL** framework combining long- and short-distance GNNs for ERC tasks, improving emotion classification on **IEMOCAP** and **MELD** datasets.  
[Paper (arXiv:2507.15205)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15205) | [Code (GitHub)](https://github.com/LiXinran6/LSDGNN_ICL)

**3. A Unified Framework for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis via Expert-Guided Multimodal Fusion with Large Language Models**  
*Submitted to ICASSP 2026* — **Third Author (Second among students)**  
> Proposed an **Expert-Guided Multimodal Fusion (EGMF)** framework integrating multimodal cues via LLMs and LoRA fine-tuning, achieving superior results on **MELD**, **CHERMA**, **MOSEI**, and **SIMS-V2** datasets.

**4. CheX-DS: Improving Chest X-ray Image Classification with Ensemble Learning Based on DenseNet and Swin Transformer**  
*IEEE BIBM 2024 (**CCF B**)* — **First Author**  
> Designed **CheX-DS**, combining DenseNet and Swin Transformer for long-tail medical image classification, achieving **83.76% AUC** on NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset.
