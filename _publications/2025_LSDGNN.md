abstract: "This work introduces Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Networks (LSD-GNNs) to model both local and global contextual dependencies in conversations for emotion recognition. An improved curriculum learning strategy is applied to optimize training. Experiments show the proposed model outperforms previous approaches on benchmark datasets."
