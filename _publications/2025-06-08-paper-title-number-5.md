abstract: "The automatic diagnosis of chest diseases is a challenging task. CheX-DS leverages DenseNet and Swin Transformer using ensemble learning. The model addresses data imbalance with a combined weighted binary cross-entropy and asymmetric loss. Evaluated on NIH ChestX-ray14, CheX-DS achieves an average AUC of 83.76%, outperforming previous studies."
